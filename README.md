Lament Configuration Puzzle Box

Work in progress based of my previous designs (eg. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4641303)

For this design I was looking for a more satisfying puzzle. I'm still playing with ideas, but an internal labrynth style maze using interplay between the two extarnal dials seems promising.

I'm not happy with the magnetic latch idea. It just didn't work the way I'd imagined it would. Stashing it here in case something else comes to mind. It was kind of workable using a washer somehow attached to a nail for manipulation in combination with "slap" moves - I just thought this was not a satisfying puzzle and likely to put a nail through someones hand. Alternatively a bent over nail could manipulate the magnets directly and kind of adds a Pinhead theme.
